This Project is a primitive RPG made with C++. It features a Unit class which creates an interactable entity with a name, two sub-classes called "Infected" and "Skeleton" that have their own unique features and an Item class used to create equippables than can modify stats. At the moment the basic gameloop only consists of fighting randomly generated enemies one after another until you either run out of HP or decide you've had enough and quit.
